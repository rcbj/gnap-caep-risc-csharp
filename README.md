# gnap-caep-risc

A server-side [GNAP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9635) client. The key is registered by value and proved with mutual TLS, an HTTP message signature, or a detached JWS. Access tokens are key-bound; a bearer token is refused. One Shared Signals poll stream carries CAEP and RISC events.

The private key stays in this process. The same `gnap.json` shape as the Python and Node libraries loads: the JSON keys are identical.

## Build and tests

```bash
docker build --target test .
```

The `test` stage runs `dotnet test --nologo` in `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0`. GitHub Actions uses that command. Do not run the .NET SDK on the host. The demo image does not run the suite.

Package id: `IyaSec.GnapCaepRisc`. Namespace: `IyaSec.Gnap`. A pull request merged into `main` publishes the package to nuget.org after the test workflow succeeds on that commit. A direct push does not. The key comes from nuget.org Trusted Publishing (`NuGet/login` trades the workflow's GitHub OIDC token for a one-hour API key); the `NUGET_USER` repository secret is the nuget.org profile name that owns the policy for this repository and `publish.yml`. A version already on nuget.org stays there; the next release is a new `Version` in the library's `.csproj`.

## Three calls

```csharp
var client = GnapClient.FromFile("gnap.json");
var started = client.RequestGrant();
var done = client.FinishRedirect(query, new[] { started.Pending.Id });
```

`RequestGrant` returns a redirect and a pending grant. `FinishRedirect` checks the interaction hash against grants this process started, then continues the grant with the key proof. Pass the pending ids this browser was given.

`ConfigLoader.Resolve` loads the same document without starting a grant.

## Signals

`signals` omitted or `true` keeps CAEP and RISC on. The resolved configuration omits the key, fills `ssf` from `ssf.transmitter` or `transmitterIssuer`, and asks for `ssf.read` and `ssf.manage` when `access` does not say otherwise.

`signals: false` does not start the Shared Signals receiver, does not require transmitter metadata, and drops `ssf.read` and `ssf.manage` from the GNAP access. The resolved configuration includes `signals: false`. If those two rights were the only ones, configuration fails and asks for another right the authorization server grants. Any other value fails with `signals must be true or false`.

`ssf.pollIntervalMs` is the poll interval in milliseconds. `SignalsReceiver.Stop` waits until the poll already in flight has finished.

## Demo

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

`PORT` defaults to 3000 and is the bind port. Loopback finish and display URLs follow `PORT`. Any other host is left as written. `PUBLIC_URL` or `--public-url` replaces the origin and keeps the path. `GET /healthz` returns `ok`. The home page has a sign-in control; `/login` starts a grant, `/callback` finishes it, and `POST /logout` signs out.

The shipped `demo/gnap.json` leaves `signals` on by omitting the key. Key material is `file:` or `env:` and is not in the tree. Register the application with:

```bash
ADMIN_API_CLIENT_SECRET=… python scripts/configure_iya_sts.py --config demo/gnap.json
```

`--dry-run` prints the admin API calls and sends nothing. When the `gnap-demo` container is running, its `PORT` wins over the shell `PORT`.
